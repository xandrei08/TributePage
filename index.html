                 wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
             </li>
             <li><strong>1945</strong>  Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>

                 <strong>1953</strong>  crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
                 creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
             </li>

                 <strong>1962</strong>  Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian

                 modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that
                 GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals
                 for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
